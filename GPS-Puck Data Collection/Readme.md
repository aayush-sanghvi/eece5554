# GPS-Puck Data collection

To execute this code, download the src folder into your local repository and run
```
catkin_make
```
This will create two new folders, devel and build
```
source devel/setup.bash
```
To execute the code, execute the following command
```
roslaunch driver.launch port:=‚Äù/dev/tty****
```
*Replace **** with USB port number on which GPS puck is connected*

This project collects and records data from GNSS puck into a bag file, decodes the message header format to accept data of "$GPGGA" format only, assigns each data to a message variable, and finally publishes the message to gps node. 
Two sets of data are recorded,
1. GPS puck is stationary
2. GPS puck is moving

For the analysis part, data was then converted into UTM-Easting and UTM-Northing and plotted against time and each other. UTM-Easting vs UTM-Northing graph would display the path travelled and latitude and the longitude of the sensor.
