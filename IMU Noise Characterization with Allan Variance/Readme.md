This project collects and records data from Real Time Kinematics puck into a bag file, decodes the message header format to accept data of "$GNGGA" format only, assigns each data to a message variable, and finally publishes the message to gps node. Two sets of data are recorded.
GPS puck is stationary
GPS puck is moving
